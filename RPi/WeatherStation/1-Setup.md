# RASPBERRY PI WEATHER STATION
```
RASPBERRY PI WEATHER STATION FOR SCHOOLS
  - Use a predefined Raspberry Pi hardware kit to build their own weather station and write application code that logs a range of weather data including wind speed, direction, temperature,pressure,and humidity.
  - Write applications to interrogate their weather station and record data in a cloud-hosted Oracle Application Express database
  - Interrogate the database via SQL to enable macro level data analysis
  - Develp a website on the Raspberry Pi to display local weather conditions that can be accessed by other participating schools
  - Access a Weather Station for Schools Program website to see the geographical location of all weather stations in the program, locate the websites of other participating schools, interact with other participants about their experiences, blog, and online technical support.
```
The scheme has been broken down into three main phase of learning resources:
  1. Collection:
    Here you'll learn about interfacing with the sensors, understanding how they work and writing Python code to talk to them. You'll finish off by recording the measurements in a MySQL database hosted on the Pi and deploying your weather station in an outdoor location in the grounds of your school.
  2. Display:
    This will involve creating an Apache, PHP 7 and JavaScript website to display the measurement being collected by your weather station.
  3. Interpretation of Weather
    Here you'll learn how to discern patterns in weather data,analyse them and use them to inform predictions about future weather.This will be done for both local weather(Using your own data) and national weather(Using data from the Oracle cloud databse online).

**SCC3 conformal coating being applied to the air sensors to protect the soldering from atmospheric corrosion, Use bits of sticky tape, conformal coating needs to protect the solder joints on the board, but not block up the air holes on the sensors.**
